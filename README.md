# About
DMHDev's Password Generator simple C++ console application to generate passwords as randomly as possibly with lots of randomizing options such as strength and ASCII character coverage.

# Downloads 
It can be downloaded in [releases](https://github.com/DenisMasterHerobrine/PasswordGenerator/releases) section.

# How To Use
- Simply download the executable from the releases section and run it. You'll find instructions on the screen.
- However, if you won't understand, you need to specify the password strength (it can be from 1 to 9, recommended value is 4 or 5, since they're are the most compatible ones with applications or websites, where you want to use it) and length of the password. Length can be up to Integer maximum value. Recommended length is more than 20 symbols, but less than 1024. (You never going to type these passwords by hand, aren't you?)

# Licensing and PRs
DMHDev's Password Generator is licensed under MIT License. While this is just a simple utility console application, you can still send Pull Requests to this project to make the generator better, but be warned that I can easily decline it if I wish to, since this is just a personal project I worked on just to make my life a bit secure or easier. Thank you for understanding me.
